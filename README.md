# Stable Diffusion Image Generation

Welcome! This guide will help you set up and use the Stable Diffusion model to generate images from text prompts.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following Python packages installed: `diffusers`, `transformers`, `torch`, and `torchvision`. You can install these using pip.

## Usage Guide

1. **Import Required Libraries**: Ensure you import the necessary libraries.
2. **Check for GPU Availability**: The script will check and use a CUDA-enabled GPU if available, or default to CPU.
3. **Define Model and Prompt**: Specify the pre-trained model and the text prompt for the image you want to generate.
4. **Load the Pipeline**: Load the model pipeline and move it to the GPU for faster processing.
5. **Generate the Image**: Create an image based on your text prompt.
6. **Save the Image**: The generated image will be saved to your local disk.
7. **Display the Image**: If using a supported environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebooks), the script will display the image.

## Notes

- Ensure you have a compatible GPU and the necessary CUDA drivers installed.
- Modify the text prompt to generate different images.
- The generated image will be saved in the current working directory.
